### Migrations are Django's way of propagating changes you make to your models into your database schema.

- 'migrate', which is responsible for applying and unapplying migrations.
- 'makemigrations', which is responsible for creating new migrations based on the changes you have made to your models.
You should think of migrations as a version control system for your database schema. makemigrations is responsible for packaging up your model changes into individual migration files - analogous to commits - and migrate is responsible for applying those to your database.

$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate


python manage.py runserver



* Configure postgreSQL into django settings.py file *
PostgreSQL is the most capable of all the databases here in terms of schema support.
